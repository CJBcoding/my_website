<p>Hi, I am a Master in Financial Analysis (MFA2021) student at London Business School.</p>
<p>Before starting my masters program here in London, I studied Business Administration at the University of St.Â Gallen in Switzerland. After,
graduating in 2018, I took an extended GAP year to gain more experience in all the field that fascinate me. Therefore, I started with a
four-month Data Science Bootcamp at ETH Zurich where I developed together with a physicist a AI-based prediction platform for time series data.
Afterwards, I gained some experience in investment banking at Rothschild followed by further internships at the Boston Consulting Group and Bain and Company.</p>
<p>In my free time, I love do sports such as field hockey, golf, and tennis which are great to keep a balance during intense times at work. Beyond that, I
am always looking for new side project in the field of data science with a link to the financial markets. Currently, I am working on an algorithmic trading system.</p>
<p>Happy to connect, so feel free to reach out.</p>
