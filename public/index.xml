      <description>Returns of financial stocks We will use the tidyquant package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.
We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald’s as MCD, etc. The file nyse.csv contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker symbol, name, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am a Master in Financial Analysis (MFA2021) student at London Business School.
Before starting my masters program here in London, I studied Business Administration at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. After, graduating in 2018, I took an extended GAP year to gain more experience in all the field that fascinate me. Therefore, I started with a four-month Data Science Bootcamp at ETH Zurich where I developed together with a physicist a AI-based prediction platform for time series data.</description>
